            Curious about me? Here you have it:
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            I&apos;m a passionate,{' '}
            self-proclaimed frontend developer{' '}
            with a strong foundation in design and a growing passion for full stack development. My journey into tech began through collaboration â€” as a graphic designer, I was invited by friends in software engineering to help design UI components for their projects. That early exposure sparked a deep interest, 
            and I soon found myself immersed in the world of code.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
          Back in 2015, I challenged myself to recreate a user interface using Photoshop and Dreamweaver â€” not because I had to, but to prove I could. Since then, I've grown from designing in Figma to building dynamic web interfaces with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Next.js. Today, I'm expanding my skills into backend technologies like Python, Django, and MySQL, with a long-term 
          goal of becoming a fully proficient full stack developer.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
          My approach is design-led: I care deeply about aesthetics, usability, and crafting experiences that are intuitive and impactful. I'm currently freelancing while continuing to learn and build, driven by a desire to offer tech solutions that make life easier for users â€” whether that's an Uber-like 
          driver app or an e-commerce platform connecting buyers and sellers.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
          When &apos;m not coding, you&apos;ll likely find me watching movies,
           exploring creative ideas, or chasing a bit of adventure.
            One day, I hope to lead a tech company focused on solving
             real-world problems through smart, accessible, 
             and beautifully crafted software. {' '}
